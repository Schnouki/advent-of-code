# Advent of Code

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an Advent calendar of small programming
puzzles.

I just do this for fun. Usually in Python, but I may try other programming
languages. Sometimes I try to do things cleanly, sometimes I don't even bother.
Sometimes I try to be clever, sometimes I just use brute borce. Sometimes I even
write some comments :)

Please, try to solve the puzzles by yourself before using these solutions!
