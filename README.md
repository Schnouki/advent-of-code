# Advent of Code

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an Advent calendar of small programming
puzzles.

I just do this for fun. Usually in Python, but I may try other programming
languages. Sometimes I try to do things cleanly, sometimes I don't even bother.
Sometimes I try to be clever, sometimes I just use brute borce. Sometimes I even
write some comments :)

Please, try to solve the puzzles by yourself before using these solutions!


## 2017

My first Advent of Code! üòä

Everything done in Python.


## 2018

This year I tried to do it in Scheme... and failed hard after a few days. Maybe one day I'll go back and finish it.


## 2019 [![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~schnouki/advent-of-code/aoc2019.yml.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~schnouki/advent-of-code/aoc2019.yml?)

Let's do it for fun this time! Python, with a common and unified setup for scripts, test data, input, etc.

It even has a CI that run all scripts after each commit! üòÅ


## 2020 [![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~schnouki/advent-of-code/commits/aoc2020.yml.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~schnouki/advent-of-code/commits/aoc2020.yml)

Let's do this again! Still in Python, with the same framework as last year, and with CI on Sourcehut üéâ
